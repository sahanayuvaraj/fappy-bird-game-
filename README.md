# feather dash -game-
Feather Dash is a fun 2D game where you play as a bird and try to fly through as many pipes as possible without crashing. It’s kind of like Flappy Bird. You have to time your taps to keep the bird in the air and avoid obstacles. It gets harder the longer you play!
how to play
Press the spacebar or left click to flap your wings and go up.

Don’t hit the pipes or the ground or it’s game over.

When the game ends, press the Restart button to try again!
some of the changes i made where 
BirdMovement.cs

I added animation to the bird when it flaps.

I also made gravity affect the bird more realistically.

GameManager.cs

I made it show the Game Over screen when you lose.

I added a Restart button so you can play again without closing the game.

PipeSpawner.cs

I changed how often the pipes appear.

I also made the pipes appear at random heights to make it harder.

im honestly proud that i got the animation to work i had to try a couple times it didn't work the first time but i got it and it feels like a real game now 
the challenges i faced were when i couldn't get the brid to animate up and down and flap the wimgs 
and when you lose it restarts the whole game but it didn't and kept going so i used SceneManager.LoadScene to reload it.
